## Key AI Agent Functions

### 1. Personalization Agent

This agent builds individual user profiles based on historical behavior and preferences:

```python
class PersonalizationAgent:
    def __init__(self, user_history_db, model_path):
        self.user_profiles = {}
        self.history_db = user_history_db
        self.model = joblib.load(model_path)
        
    def build_user_profile(self, user_id):
        # Extract user history
        history = self.history_db.get_user_history(user_id)
        
        # Analyze content preferences
        content_preferences = self._analyze_content_preferences(history)
        
        # Analyze timing preferences
        timing_preferences = self._analyze_timing_preferences(history)
        
        # Create profile
        self.user_profiles[user_id] = {
            'content_preferences': content_preferences,
            'best_time_to_send': timing_preferences,
            'engagement_score': self._calculate_engagement_score(history)
        }
        
        return self.user_profiles[user_id]
```

### 2. Content Optimization Agent

This agent uses NLP to analyze and improve email content:

```python
class ContentOptimizationAgent:
    def __init__(self, content_db, model_path):
        self.content_db = content_db
        self.model = joblib.load(model_path)
        self.nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')
        
    def optimize_subject_line(self, draft_subject, user_profile):
        # Generate subject line variations
        variations = self._generate_variations(draft_subject)
        
        # Score each variation for the specific user
        scores = []
        for var in variations:
            features = self._extract_features(var, user_profile)
            score = self.model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
            scores.append((var, score))
        
        # Return top 3 recommendations
        top_subjects = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:3]
        return top_subjects
    
    def optimize_email_body(self, draft_body, user_profile):
        # Similar optimization for email body
        # Includes sentiment analysis, readability scoring, etc.
        pass
```

### 3. Timing Optimization Agent

This agent determines the optimal time to send emails:

```python
class TimingOptimizationAgent:
    def __init__(self, interaction_db):
        self.interaction_db = interaction_db
        
    def get_optimal_send_time(self, user_id):
        # Get historical open data
        open_history = self.interaction_db.get_open_times(user_id)
        
        if not open_history:
            # Use global best times if no user history
            return self._get_global_best_time()
            
        # Analyze open patterns
        weekday_hours = self._analyze_weekday_hour_patterns(open_history)
        
        # Get next optimal time window
        next_window = self._get_next_optimal_window(weekday_hours)
        
        return next_window
```

### 4. Campaign Orchestration Agent

This agent oversees the entire email campaign process:

```python
class CampaignOrchestrationAgent:
    def __init__(self, personalization_agent, content_agent, timing_agent):
        self.personalization_agent = personalization_agent
        self.content_agent = content_agent
        self.timing_agent = timing_agent
        
    def orchestrate_campaign(self, campaign_template, user_list):
        campaign_plan = []
        
        for user_id in user_list:
            # Get user profile
            profile = self.personalization_agent.build_user_profile(user_id)
            
            # Optimize content
            subject = self.content_agent.optimize_subject_line(
                campaign_template['subject'], profile)
            body = self.content_agent.optimize_email_body(
                campaign_template['body'], profile)
                
            # Determine send time
            send_time = self.timing_agent.get_optimal_send_time(user_id)
            
            # Create personalized campaign element
            campaign_plan.append({
                'user_id': user_id,
                'subject': subject[0][0],  # Top recommended subject
                'body': body,
                'send_time': send_time,
                'expected_click_rate': subject[0][1]  # Predicted probability
            })
            
        return campaign_plan
```
